I am a passionate IT professional with a strong background in network engineering and cybersecurity, currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at IMF Smart Education in Madrid. With over 5 years of experience in the tech industry.

Throughout my career, I’ve honed my expertise in network protocols (TCP, DHCP, DNS, VPN, Firewall) and starting with security operations such as Penetration Testing, Cyber Threat Hunting using KQL on KC7, and Incident Response. I hold multiple certifications, including Microsoft SC-900 and eJPTv2, and have actively contributed to projects, mentoring, and training within my teams.

My goal is to continue developing my skills in cybersecurity, particularly in Ethical Hacking (Red Team) and Security Analysis (Blue Team), with a focus on ethical hacking, threat analysis, vulnerability management, and advanced incident response.

## Objective

My journey and passion with computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Security Analyst or becoming a Pentester, towards my end goal of knowledge in a combination of both red and blue team. To become a great purple team addition.
